This exploit requires the use of a ghost upgrade

> Future updates that re-balance weapon stats, or some custom community missions that use different upgrade files may change this. Like most credit exploits, it uses the minus out and refund features of the game, so it's only doable before Wave 1. Since every weapon upgrades discovered so far require a starting cash of more than $400, this isn't currently possible to use for Gear Grinder. At least until someone figures out how to do it for a lower credit amount, but I've tried and have yet to find a way.

So the exploit done with `The Wrap Assassin` and `The Vaccinator`. Technically a few other weapons should also be doable but, due to their higher credit threshold to perform, it's really just those two.

Find more information over here : [https://tcrf.net/Development:Team_Fortress_2/April_21st,\_2020_Codebase_Leak](https://tcrf.net/Development:Team_Fortress_2/April_21st,_2020_Codebase_Leak)

1.  You simply max out each of the weapons ghost upgrades. So for The Wrap Assassin you get its recharge rate up to +60%, and for the Vaccinator you get its ubercharge rate up to +100%.
2.  You then exit the upgrade station, and re-enter it.
3.  Now you minus out all available upgrade ticks, and then refund. You should then have all of your credits back, and the weapons will still have higher than default recharge/ubercharge rate attributes.
4.  So then click all the ticks for them as if you're maxing out the upgrades again, and then minus them out. You will have now gained 250/300 credits.

—   Repeat this process to receive free money.

You're partially limited by latency on how fast you can go. You'll be familiar with this concept if you play on high latency servers often, where sometimes upgrades don't go through if you exit the upgrade station too quickly.

Okay, back to me, LewdDev

You read that wall of text above yet?

So you, the user, wondering how to use this piece of crap

Simple, you load the lua, you play vacc medic, then you go to the nearest Upgrades station, and you hold `L`

A fully upgraded loadout takes about 11000 to 17000 credits, which is about 2 minutes if you can afford internet

If this exploit gets patched in the future, one could probably repurpose this lua as a base for their MvM autobuy script
